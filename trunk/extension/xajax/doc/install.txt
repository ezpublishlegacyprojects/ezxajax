******************************

Make sure the rewrite rules of your virtual host configuration allow direct 
access to JavaScript files inside extensions. Using the rewrite rules mentioned 
at http://ez.no/doc/ez_publish/technical_manual/3_6/installation/virtual_host_setup 
should work fine.


 1. Move settings file
******************************

Move (NOT copy) the xajax.ini file from the settings directory of the xajax 
extension to the main settings directory under your eZ publish root.

Don't skip this step! Otherwise it's possible that some xajax plugins don't 
get loaded depending on the order of the activated extensions.


 2. Activate extension
******************************

Activate the xajax extension by using the admin interface
or in settings/override/site.ini.append(.php):

[ExtensionSettings]
ActiveExtensions[]=xajax


 3. Insert xajax JavaScript
******************************

Insert the necessary xajax JavaScript between the opening and closing head tags 
in your pagelayouts. You can use the xajax_javascript template operator to do this. 

You won't register new functions with xajax regularly, so you can place it in a 
non-expiring cache block.

{cache-block ignore_content_expiry expiry=0}
{xajax_javascript()}
{/cache-block}


 4. Add module policy
******************************

Add a policy for the xajax module to the desired roles.


 5. Clear caches
******************************

You will probably need to clear the INI and template caches.
