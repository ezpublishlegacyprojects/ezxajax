 Features
************
The xajax extension integrates the xajax PHP class library (http://www.xajaxproject.org/) 
into eZ publish. It allows you to easily create powerful, web-based, Ajax applications.


 Usage
************

The xajax extension only contains the base files needed to make your eZ publish installation 
ready for xajax. Specific xajax functions are placed in other extensions.

Try out the xajax ClassAttributes extension (http://ez.no/community/contribs/hacks/xajax_classattributes) 
to see how xajax can speedup the use of the admin interface.

Documentation on how to write your own xajax eZ publish function plugins will be written soon.
